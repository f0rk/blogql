blogql is blog software written in (mostly) pl/pgsql

It has very few features (more is less, right?) and looks like no
thought was given to its styling (not yet, anyway).

It uses Net::Server::HTTP to actually handle client requests. Maybe
someday I'll figure out how to get the whole thing inside Postgres.
